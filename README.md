# coursera-project
A project related to the Coursera "The Data Scientist's Toolbox" course

This is my second attempt to create a repo, with a new branch for edits to pull and merge. This time, I ensured to selecton the correct branch (not the master) so I keep the version control accurate. 

This is my second attempt to make a change to the file, but this time create a new branch to merge later.
